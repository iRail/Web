iRail - Mobile Website

Demo here: http://dev.mathiasbaert.be/irail-web/

This is a demo web application for the JavaScript wrapper around the iRail API.
The API uses JSONP, but the wrapper hides that detail for you.

API-Wrapper
The API-Wrapper wraps this API pretty close http://project.irail.be/cgi-bin/trac.fcgi/wiki/APIv1
but the result is JSON and some inconsistencies are taken care of.

For documentation on the API-Wrapper methods, go look at https://github.com/iRail/Web/blob/master/js/irail-api.js
where they are documented in detail. 
Idealy documentation get generated from the inline documentation,
but in the meantime I don't want to have manually duplicated information here

I'm looking for a designer!
I'm looking for testers with mobile devices! (I have only an iPhone)
